        <ul>
          <li>Nelson Mandela was born on the 18th July 1918 in the village of Mvezo, which is located in an area of South Africa called Transkei. His father's name was Henry, and his mother was called Nosekeni Fanny.</li>
          <li>As a youngster, little Nelson was actually called Rolihlahla - it wasn't until he was seven that a teacher at school gave him the name 'Nelson', and it stuck!</li>
          <li>And check this out... Nelson was born into royalty! His father, Henry, was chief of a tribe in South Africa called the Tembu, and his great grandfather was the tribe's king! But sadly, Nelson was just twelve years old when his father died.

          </li>
          <li>Nelson studied hard at school and later attended the University of Fort Hare, the South African Native College. He then moved to the city of Johannesburg to study law at the University of the Witwatersrand, before qualifying as a lawyer in 1942, aged 24.

          </li>
          <li>This activism made him very unpopular with the authorities, and Nelson was arrested for treason – the crime of betraying your country’s government – several times.

          </li>
          <li>While Nelson was under arrest in the late 1950s, the government banned anti-apartheid groups such as the ANC. But that didn’t stop Nelson and his fellow activists – in fact, they felt more had to be done to bring about change.

          </li>
          <li>So, even though they preferred using peaceful protests in their struggle for equality, in 1961 Nelson and other ANC leaders formed a secret military group called Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation.

          </li>
          
        </ul>
        <h2>What did Nelson Mandela do?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Nelson Mandela became an important figure in the ANC, and he helped set up and lead a section for young people called the ANC Youth League. He later travelled the country to gain support for non-violent protests against the National Party’s racist laws, too.
